# Life Gamification App

A desktop application inspired by The Sims that helps track your energy, focus, and productivity with status bars. I built this to help manage my ADHD symptoms and make daily tasks more engaging through gamification.

## What It Does

- Shows a small overlay on your desktop with status bars (like in The Sims)
- Tracks things like energy, focus, and mood
- Gives you points and achievements for completing tasks
- Helps visualize when you need to take breaks or refocus
- Stores your data locally so you can see trends over time

## Tech Stack

- C# and WPF for the UI
- .NET Framework
- Entity Framework for the database stuff
- Followed MVVM pattern (Model-View-ViewModel)

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements
- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET 7.0
- Windows 10 or 11

### How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio
3. Hit F5 to build and run

## Project Status

This is my first major project after graduating! I'm building this as a portfolio piece to show what I've learned and to practice C# development. Currently working on:

- [x] Setting up the basic window overlay
- [x] Creating the status bar UI
- [ ] Adding database storage
- [ ] Implementing point system
- [ ] Building achievement system

More features planned based on time and feedback!

## Project Structure

I'm trying to follow clean architecture principles:

```
LifeGamificationApp/
├── Core/               # Business logic, models
├── Infrastructure/     # Database, external services
└── UI/                 # WPF application
```

## Screenshots

Coming soon! (Once I have the UI working properly)

## Why I Built This

As someone with ADHD, I've always been more productive when things feel game-like. I wanted to create something that would help me stay focused while also serving as a good portfolio project to show potential employers.

Key things I'm learning:
- WPF development
- Working with databases in C#
- Software architecture patterns
- How to plan and execute a project from scratch
